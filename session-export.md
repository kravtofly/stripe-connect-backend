## Conversation Log

### Message 1 (System)
Session continuation notification - previous session ran out of context. Instructed to continue from where the conversation left off without asking further questions.

### Message 2 (User)
Asked: "why does it say session limit reached?"

### Message 3 (Assistant)
Explained that the message indicates the previous conversation hit a usage limit (token/context limit, usage limits, or time-based limits) and that "resets 11pm" means the limit will reset at that time.

Noted that I was working on branch `claude/stripe-connect-audit-011CUSywntbTuJ7n9MwskTXK` but don't have specific details about the task in progress from the previous session.

Asked user to remind me what task to continue with.

### Message 4 (User)
Requested: "can you export everything from this session in a md file?"
